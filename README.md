# test-frontend

This is the solution of question set.

## Question 1:

- `graphSet.js` constructs an example Graph represented in adjacency list with its node ID and its weight.

- `allRoutes.js` solves (a) using DFS to search for all paths.

- `shortestPath.js` solves (b) using Dijkstra algorithm to get the shortest distance from A -> H.

## Question 2:

- Question 2 is a simple SPA application using Vue 2 & CSS, built by `@vue/cli`.

- Before start developing, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` (for simplicity and demo usage, all values in `.env.example` are the same as the `.env.local`).

- Then `yarn serve` for dev, `yarn build` for build for production.
